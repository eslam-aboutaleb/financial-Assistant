Claim status lookup tool for the OmniCare agent.

Reads from Postgres to find claim information securely linked to the current user.
The lookup is scoped to the authenticated user's ``owner_id`` to prevent
horizontal privilege escalation (IDOR attacks).

    """Look up the status of an existing OmniCare insurance claim by its ID.

    Use this tool when a user asks about the status, progress, or details of
    a specific claim. The claim ID is required. The policy number is optional
    and currently unused but reserved for future enhanced filtering.

    The lookup is scoped to the authenticated user via ``current_user_id``,
    ensuring that users can only retrieve their own claim information.

    Args:
        claim_id: The unique claim identifier provided by the user.
            Example: "CLM-8821"
        policy_number: The policyholder's policy number. Currently unused
            but accepted for forward compatibility.

    Returns:
        dict: Claim status details. On success, includes ``found=True``,
        ``claim_id``, ``policy_number``, ``claim_type``, ``status``,
        ``amount``, and ``citation``. On failure, includes ``found=False``
        and an ``error`` message.
