"""
Database session factory and engine configuration for the OmniCare backend.

This module centralizes SQLAlchemy async engine setup and provides the
``get_db`` FastAPI dependency used by every endpoint that requires a database
session. It also exposes ``create_all_tables`` for startup-time schema
initialization (used in development and Docker build contexts).

Design decisions:
  - ``expire_on_commit=False`` prevents SQLAlchemy from expiring ORM instances
    after each commit, which avoids extra SELECT queries in read-heavy flows.
  - ``create_all_tables`` imports models inside the function body rather than
    at module scope. This ensures the declarative base metadata is fully
    populated before ``create_all`` runs, while also avoiding circular import
    issues during module initialization.

# for every checkout and closes it on return. The test suite runs each request on a
# different event loop (the ``TestClient`` portal loop, then the fixture reset's own
# ``asyncio.run`` loop). A pooling engine can hand a live connection to a loop other
# than the one that created it, which asyncpg rejects with "got Future attached to a
# different loop" and which surfaces as an intermittent 401 or a missing row rather
# than as an obvious error. NullPool makes that impossible.
