"""Tests for the ``db_session`` fixture's isolation guarantee.

The fixture promises that a test can commit real work and have it rolled back. A naive
``AsyncSession.begin()`` implementation breaks that promise: it creates the session's
root transaction, so a ``commit()`` inside the test persists, and the teardown rollback
then runs against a deactivated transaction.

These tests verify the promise by committing inside a test and confirming nothing
survived.
